# Pages

Standalone pages for a multi-page portfolio architecture.

## Main pages

- `portfolio.html` (home)
- `pages/projects/index.html` (full project gallery)
- `pages/process.html`
- `pages/about.html`
- `pages/contact.html`

## Project case studies

Current case-study pages in `pages/projects/`:

- `docchat-rag-production.html`
- `rag-evaluation-lab.html`
- `support-ai-triage.html`
- `sql-docs-hybrid-agent.html`
- `knowledge-base-builder.html`

## New case-study flow

1. Copy `pages/_template/project-case-study.html`.
2. Rename file with a kebab-case slug.
3. Add it to `pages/projects/index.html` gallery.
4. Create/update matching folder under `projects/<slug>/` for presentations and assets.
