# Project Template

Copy this folder to create a new portfolio project:

- `case-study/`: project write-up and section content.
- `assets/`: project-specific visuals/files.
- `presentations/upcoming/`: active decks in progress.
- `presentations/archive/`: finalized decks.

Recommended slug format: `kebab-case` (example: `semantic-router-lab`).
